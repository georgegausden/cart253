# Make Some Noise

In this simulation, the balls move around and occasionally touch the side of the canvas. When they touch the canvas, a sound is produced that reflects the magnitude of the velocity of that particular ball. The background colour is based on the average of the magnitudes of velocity of all the balls in the simulation. The user can control the speed and the size of all the balls in the simulation.
